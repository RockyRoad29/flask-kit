Welcome to Flask Kit's documentation!
=====================================

Flask Kit is extendable backbone for your new `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ projects
and the set of useful helpers to avoid some routine.

It makes use of some useful extensions from
`official Flask extensions registry <http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/>`_.

Have a look in :mod:`ext` and :mod:`app` to see how they are used.

Below a brief description for each of them.
Check the :file:`reqs.pip` for the actual version numbers .
